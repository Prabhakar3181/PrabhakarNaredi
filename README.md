This is my e-commerce project 
 tech stacks used are only HTML and CSS
 I build this website from scratch with no use of javascript and bootstrap
 This website is ShoeStop where you get amazing type of shoes rhat you need in your daily life to make your life comfortable and stylish.
 I have three pages on it :
 First: Home Page( Having background image, logo and link to proceed) 
 Second: Preview page(Have some shoes displayed , some with thier prices, an explore now button that leads to products page)
 Third: Product Page( contain the product list)
 Fourth : Log In page( contains username, password)
 A navigation bar is also present at top of second, third, fourth page so as to help you to navigate easily
 I also added name , price , add to cart , whishlist buttons(non functional)
 A search bar on navigation menu is also there.(non functional)
 There is an footer section also 
 I tried my best to create a website by using only HTML and CSS.
